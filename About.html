            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                With a foundation rooted in a sound academic background and practical experience, I've cultivated a career as a draftsman characterized by diligence and dedication. Since 2018, I've been actively engaged in the realm of drafting, contributing to a variety of projects spanning architectural, structural, and MEP domains. My tenure at Creatz Constructions, where I've served as a Draughtsman since January 2021, has been instrumental in honing my skills and expertise. Here, I've liaised with clients to discern their requirements, conducted site visits to grasp contextual nuances, and meticulously crafted proposals and detailed drawings for construction endeavors. Prior to this, my role as a Structural Steel Detailer at H&R Steel Detailing equipped me with a keen understanding of building specifications, regulatory frameworks, and coordination with multidisciplinary teams. This hands-on experience has fortified my ability to navigate complex project landscapes, ensuring seamless collaboration and the attainment of project milestones.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                My academic journey commenced with the successful completion of the G.C.E Advanced Level Examination in 2011 from Tissa National College, Kalutara, specializing in the mathematics stream. Building upon this foundation, I pursued further vocational qualifications to augment my technical prowess. From January 2017 to December 2017, I undertook the National Certificate in Engineering Draughtsmanship NVQ 4 at Technical College, Kalutara, followed by the attainment of a National Diploma in Construction Technology NVQ 5 from the College of Technology, Colombo, spanning from January 2022 to December 2024. Additionally, my commitment to staying abreast of industry trends and advancements led me to pursue specialized training in BIM with Revit Architecture at Architech CAD Academy from January 2023 to December 2023. Most recently, I completed a Predictive Course in Project Management Institute in April 2024, further enhancing my repertoire of skills and competencies.
            </p>
            <h2>Proficiency in Software</h2>
            <p>
