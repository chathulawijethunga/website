          <!-- Description -->
          <div class="description">
            <p>The project involves creating plumbing drawings for a 3-story residential building located in the heart of Kottawa city area. The ground floor is designated for the owner and their family's use, while the upper floors are intended for rent. The main water source for the building is provided by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB). The plumbing system is designed to transfer water directly from the NWSDB supply to a sump, and then utilize a transfer pump to pump water to the rooftop terrace where overhead water tanks are located. Four 5000-liter tanks are installed on the rooftop terrace to store water for the building's usage.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Efficient design of plumbing system to ensure adequate water supply to all floors of the building.</li>
                <li>Integration of transfer pump system to facilitate water transfer from the sump to overhead tanks.</li>
